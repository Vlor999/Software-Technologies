1. Is the outcome of the tools meaningful? What would be required to make it meaningful?
The outcome of the tools is meaningful as it highlights specific issues in the code, particularly related to indentation. These issues are critical for maintaining code readability and adhering to coding standards. However, the output could be made more meaningful by:

Providing context for the errors: The tool should explain why the specific indentation levels are expected and how they align with the coding standards.
Grouping similar issues: Instead of listing each error individually, grouping errors by type or section of the code would make the output easier to interpret.
Suggesting fixes: The tool could provide auto-correction suggestions or commands to reformat the code automatically.
Reducing verbosity: The output is lengthy and repetitive, which can overwhelm the user. Summarizing the errors with a detailed breakdown in an appendix would improve usability.
Additionally, it is worth noting that the header limitation was deleted to avoid issues with the Checkstyle bash function. This modification ensured that the tool could run without interruptions but may have impacted the scope of the analysis by excluding header-related checks.

2. Is the outcome of the tools supportive and similar to the one obtained from the code review?
The outcome of the tools is supportive and likely similar to what would be obtained from a manual code review. A code review would also identify the same indentation issues but might provide additional context, such as the impact of these issues on code maintainability and readability. However, the tool's output is more exhaustive and precise in pinpointing the exact lines and types of errors, which might be missed in a manual review.

3. Explanation of the Outcome
The Checkstyle tool identified numerous indentation issues in the file NaturalRanking.java. Specifically, the errors indicate that:

case statements are indented at level 12 instead of the expected level 8.
Blocks within case statements are indented at level 16 instead of the expected level 12.
Control structures (if, while) and their children are misaligned, with indentation levels exceeding the expected levels.
These issues suggest a lack of adherence to the project's coding style guidelines, which could lead to reduced readability and potential confusion for developers working on the codebase. The errors are consistent throughout the file, indicating a systemic issue with indentation practices.

Appendix
Tool Output Summary:

Total Errors: 50+
Error Type: Indentation
Affected File: NaturalRanking.java
Additional Notes:

The header limitation was deleted to avoid issues with the Checkstyle bash function. While this allowed the tool to run smoothly, it may have excluded header-related checks from the analysis.
Recommendations:

Use an IDE or tool with auto-formatting capabilities to enforce consistent indentation.
Integrate Checkstyle into the CI/CD pipeline to catch such issues early.
Provide developers with training or documentation on the project's coding standards.
