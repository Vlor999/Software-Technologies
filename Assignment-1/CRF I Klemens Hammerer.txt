-----------------------

1.) General: 

Does the code work?
* Yeah the Code works as intended

Does it perform its intended function, the logic is correct etc.?
* It generates a interpolated/regressed line into the 2 Dimensional plane 

Is all the code easily understood?
* ALl except the regression part itself where some Magic is happening

Does it conform to your agreed coding conventions?
* Variable names, Function names and these kind of things are being followed yeah

Is the code as modular as possible?
* Yes, it is

Is there any redundant or duplicate code?
* No, every part where Redundant Code would have been needed, functions were written to omit that

Can any global variables be replaced?
* There are none, so no.

Is there any commented-out code?
* No there isn't.

Do loops have a set length and correct termination conditions?
* Yes, they all stop when iterator i reaches data.length.

Can any of the code be replaced with library functions?
* No, wherever library Code could be used, it's already being used (no redundant/duplicate Code!)

Can any logging or debugging code be removed?
* There is no logging/debugging in this Code.


2.) Security:

Are all data inputs checked (for the correct type, length, format, and range) and encoded?
* No they are not.

Where third-party utilities are used, are returning errors being caught?
* The third party utilities used don't throw exceptions. 

Are output values checked and encoded?
* Not Checked, but the regression function encodes the final Output into a special Data Type (RegressionResult)

Are invalid parameter values handled?
* Only where wrong parameters could result in undefined Behaviour. (Empty list in for loop just doesn't do anything but as a list of parameters for another function it has to be checked which it is)

3.) Documentation:

Do comments exist and describe the intent of the code?
* No, only function headers exist.

Are all functions commented?
* Yeah they are all commented with all possible parameters and return values.

Is any unusual behavior or edge-case handling described?
* Yes, edge cases are described like finding no interception point if the slope is given with NaN

Is the use and function of third-party libraries documented?
* No, but the only third-party libraries used are self explanatory ones like min and max.

Are data structures and units of measurement explained?
Data Structures are explained well. Units of measurements not but you don't need that in case of a coordinate System since coordinates don't have units of measure.

Is there any incomplete code? If so, should it be removed or flagged with a suitable marker like ‘TODO’?
* No there is no incomplete Code and there are and don't have to be any 'TODO' Flags.


4.) Testing:

Is the code testable? I.e. don’t add too many or hide dependencies, unable to initialize objects, test frameworks can use methods etc.
* Only hides one dependency, initializing Objects easy

Do tests exist, and are they comprehensive? I.e., has at least your agreed code coverage.
* Tests exist yeah. All Functions are at least tested once also with edge cases

Are arrays checked for ‘out-of-bound’ errors?
* No they are not.

Could any test code be replaced with an existing API?
* Not to my knowledge no.
